Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williams’s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.</p><p>In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the films’ wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down.

But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.<br> <br>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <i> <b>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</b> </i>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it.<br> <br>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.<br> <br> <i> <b>Clean Code</b> </i> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.<br> <br>Readers will come away from this book understanding<br> <ul> <li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code <li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code <li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes <li>How to format code for maximum readability <li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic <li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li> </ul>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.<br>');

Its broad coverage, concise explanations, and robust mathematical support are clearly presented in an engaging style to furnish students with a solid foundation in the subject. In this ninth edition the authors continue to refine their presentation of physical chemistry. The coverage of introductory topics is streamlined, and the addition of a new fundamentals chapter provides students with an overview of key principles on which the subject is based. The text includes increased coverage of computational chemistry and additional contextual examples of materials chemistry throughout, mirroring the current needs of today''s students and lecturers. Mathematics remains an intrinsic yet challenging part of physical chemistry. Extensive mathematical support, including a ''Checklist of key equations'' at the end of every chapter, and ''Mathematical background'' sections containing worked examples and self-tests, empower students to overcome any barriers to understanding that grasping the mathematical content might present. These features help to ensure the reader can master the subject without a need to sacrifice the rigour and depth of the mathematical content. The pedagogical framework, which is a hallmark of the authors'' writing, has been further strengthened. New ''Key points'' provide summaries of the main take-home messages of each section and enable students to gain an overview of the topic before tackling it in depth; ''Brief illustrations'' give a concise insight into how a particular mathematical concept is applied in practice, providing students with the opportunity to contextualise their learning. All these exciting new features and innovations are presented within a refreshed full colour text design, to stimulate and engage students yet further. The Online Resource Centre contains Living Graphs, illustrations from the book, and web links.

In addition to the preparative aspects, the book also gives the reader an impression on the relation of chemical constitution and morphology of Polymers to their properties, as well as on their application areas. Thus, an additional textbook will not be needed in order to understand the experiments. </p><p>The 5th edition contains numerous changes: In recent years, so-called functional polymers which have special electrical, electronic, optical and biological properties, have gained more and more in interest. This textbook was therefore supplemented by recipes which describe the synthesis of these materials in a new chapter "Functional polymers". Together with new experiments in chapter 3,4 and 5 the book now contains more than 120 recipes that describe a wide range of macromolecules. </p><p></p><p>From the reviews of recent editions:</p><p>"This is an excellent book for all polymer chemists engaged in synthesis research studies and education. It is educationally sound and has excellent laboratory synthetic examples. The fundamentals are well done for the teaching of students and references are resonably up-to-date. As in previous issues, there are sections dealing with an introduction; structure and nomenclature; methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing and modification of polymers.</p><p>....The authors have noted the following changes from previous editions- a new section on correlations of structure, morphology and properties; revision and enlargement of other property and characterization procedures; additional new experiments such as controlled radical polymerization; enzymatic polymerizations; microelmulsions; and electrical conducting polymers.</p><p>This is a high quality textbook at a reasonable price and should be considered as a suitable reference for all engaged in synthetic areas of polymer research."
